remove static initialization handling
consider not building indent if the log is not entrance is not visible in log {
	possible solution is not to call increaseIndent if log level is disabled 
	but what to do if it exit level is higher(we will call decrease when it is not needed - which is wrong)
	or enter level is lower (we will call decrease when it is not needed - which is wrong)
	from all of the above it seems we need to store if we increased indent for this particular method/constructor call
	
}
decide on call or on execution apply the Aspect = decided to use execution (for excha like framewors will use ordering,see how it is done in AspectJ)
handle static methods of annotated class without need of placing annotation
handle constructors

let people replace LoggerFactory on

provide pointcut solution for third party libs to use LogAspect for alraedy compiled libs e.g spring{
e.g
	@Log(...)
	myPointCutHitsFirstPartyLibs{}
in this case LogAspect is supposed to 

}
