upgrade aspectj
introduce tests with mockito2+powermock
add pit tests
get rid of common-lang
consider to get rid from common-beans
add best practice to documentation
usage and about must be a single page?
update examples to 1.0.8
introduce an example with load time weaving, this will require excuting java -javaagent:path/to/aspectjweaver.jar my application, which sucks.
add allow to override logger
add multiple loggers support
add lists of classes that should never be placed into logs (e.g. byte[])

consider allowing setup class wide defaults
.e.g if 
@Log(enterLevel=INFO)
class MyClass 
then 
on each @Log(you don't have to override enterLevel and just take with overriden details) e.g. templates)

find out how to separate logs into 3 categories: 
	system administrators - interested in information about status of system level operations such as:
	    
		application/service started/failed to start, stopped/failed to stop, service crashed 
			(each event should have details which will allow to identifiy problems if something goes wrong, Datasource connection url and pool size)  
	 	resource statistic
	 	
	 	
	 	
business analysts interested in log
<logger name="chapters.configuration">
    <appender-ref ref="STDOUT" />
</logger>
